# ✅📝 Task Management App

This is a simple **Python Task Management Application** that allows users to manage their daily tasks.  
Users can **add, update, delete, view, and exit** tasks interactively through the console.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- **Lists** → To store and manage tasks dynamically.  
- **Loops (for, while)** → For adding tasks and running the menu continuously.  
- **Conditional Statements (if–elif–else)** → To handle different task operations.  
- **List Methods (append, index, delete)** → To manage tasks efficiently.  
- **Basic Input/Output** → User interaction with `input()` and output with `print()`.
