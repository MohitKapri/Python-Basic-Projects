# 🔢🎯 Number Guessing Game

This is a simple **Python Number Guessing Game** where the computer randomly chooses a number between **1 and 100**, and the player has to guess it.  

### 🎮 Game Rules
- The computer selects a random number (1–100).  
- The player tries to guess the number.  
- After each guess:
  - If the guess is **too high**, the program will say *"Lower number please"*  
  - If the guess is **too low**, the program will say *"Higher number please"*  
- The game continues until the player guesses the correct number.  
- Finally, the program displays the total number of attempts.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- **Random Module** → To generate a random number between 1 and 100.  
- **While Loop** → To keep asking until the player guesses correctly.  
- **Conditional Statements (if–elif–else)** → To guide the player (higher/lower).  
- **Counters/Variables** → To keep track of number of guesses.  
- **Basic Input/Output** → Taking input with `input()` and printing hints with `print()`.
