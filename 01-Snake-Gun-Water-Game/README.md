# 🐍💧🔫 Snake–Water–Gun Game

This is a simple **Python implementation** of the classic Snake–Water–Gun game (a variation of Rock–Paper–Scissors).  

### 🎮 Game Rules
- **Snake drinks water → Snake wins**
- **Gun kills snake → Gun wins**
- **Water douses gun → Water wins**

The player selects a choice, and the computer randomly selects one. The winner is decided based on the above rules.

## 🛠️ Concepts Used
- **Python Dictionaries** → Mapping choices (`snake`, `water`, `gun`) to numeric values and back.  
- **Random Module** → To generate the computer’s random choice.  
- **Conditional Statements (if–elif–else)** → To determine the winner.  
- **String Formatting (f-strings)** → For clean and readable output.  
- **Basic Input/Output** → Taking user input with `input()` and showing results with `print()`.
